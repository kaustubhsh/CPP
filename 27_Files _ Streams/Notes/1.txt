Files and Streams:-
-----------------

In C++ programming we use the 'iostream' standard library, it provides cin and cout objects for reading from Standard I/P Device and 
writing to Standard O/P Device respectively.

To read and write from a file the standard C++ library called 'fstream' is used.

The data types defined in 'fstream' library are:
```````````````````````````````````````````````
-> ifstream			It is used to read information from files.

-> ofstream			It is used to create files and write information to the files.

-> fstream			It is used to create files, write information to files, and read information from files.
