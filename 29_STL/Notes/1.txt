Introduction to STL:- (Standard Template Library)
-------------------
STL is an acronym for Standard Template Library. It is a set of C++ template classes that provide generic classes and function that can be used to implement data structures and algorithms.

STL is mainly composed of:-
-------------------------
1) Containers
2) Algorithms
3) Iterators

1) Containers:-
-------------
Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind. 

There are several different types of containers:-
- vector
- queue
- stack
- list
- set
- map

2) Algorithms:-
-------------
Algorithms act on containers. They provide the means by which you will perform initialization, sorting, searching, and transforming of the contents of containers.

3) Iterators:-
------------
Iterators are used to point to the containers in STL. They actually acts as a bridge between containers and algorithms, means, due to iterators it is possible for an algorithm to manipulate different types of containers/data structures.
