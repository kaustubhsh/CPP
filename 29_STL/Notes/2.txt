Vector:-
------
- Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is 
  inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. 

- Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. 

- In vectors, data is inserted at the end.


Syntax for creating a vector is:-  vector< object_type > vector_name;

For example:
```````````
1)
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   vector<int> my_vector;

   return 0;
}

2)
#include <vector>

int main()
{
   std::vector<string> v = {"Pankaj" , "The" , "Java" ,"Coder"};

   return 0;
}


Functions related to vector:-
---------------------------
The push_back( ) member function inserts value at the end of the vector, expanding its size as needed.

The size( ) function displays the size of the vector.

The function begin( ) returns an iterator to the start of the vector.

The function end( ) returns an iterator to the end of the vector.
